# scripts-ipsec

These scriptis are used to configure IPSec Offload on the BF2 by 
manually creating XFRM policies and security associations in the kernel 
on both sides.  

Ask your local friendly neighborhood FAE for documentation on how
to use them.  

The BF2 UM contains details used in these scripts.  Go to 

docs.mellanox.com/category/bluefieldsw, click on the link, and search
for IPSec.
